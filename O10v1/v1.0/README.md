AUGUSTUS annotation with min intron length 5 was used to build these files

The gff3 were generated by doing the following:
```shell
gffread --force-exons --gene2exon --keep-comments --keep-genes -F -E [augustus gff]  > [gffread gff] 2> gffread.log
```

The gff3 file was recreated again from the gtf file generated below 
```shell
agat_convert_sp_gff2gtf.pl --gff infile.gtf -o outfile.gtf
agat_convert_sp_gxf2gxf.pl -g infile.gtf -o outfile.gff3
```
